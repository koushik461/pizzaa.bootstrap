                <p>Domino's Pizza started out small, with just one store in Ypsilanti, Michigan, in 1960. Fast forward more than 60 years, and Domino's has grown to become one of the most recognized and leading pizza brands in the world.</p>
                <p>In 1960, Tom Monaghan and his brother, James, purchased "DomiNick's," a pizza store in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Tom borrowed $900 to buy the store. In 1961, James traded his half of the business to Tom for a Volkswagen Beetle. By 1965, Tom, the sole owner of the company, renamed the business "Domino's Pizza Inc."</p>
                <p>Domino's opened its first franchise store in Ypsilanti, Michigan, in 1967. The company experienced rapid growth and by 1978, it had expanded to 200 stores. In 1983, Domino's opened its first international store in Winnipeg, Canada, and its 1,000th store in the U.S.</p>
                <p>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Domino's continued to innovate and expand. In 1989, the company introduced its first new product, Handmade Pan Pizza. In 1992, Domino's rolled out breadsticks, its first national non-pizza menu item. By 1995, Domino's had entered 40 international markets, including Eastern Europe and Africa, and opened its 1,000th international store.</p>
                <p>In 1998, Tom Monaghan announced his retirement and gave up ownership of the company to Bain Capital Inc. Domino's Pizza Inc. became a publicly traded company on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol DPZ in 2004.</p>
                <p>In 2007, Domino's introduced online and mobile ordering for customers, making their experience even more convenient. The company launched Domino's Tracker® in 2008, a revolutionary technology that allows customers to follow the progress of their order online.</p>
                <p>In 2009, Domino's launched its "new and inspired pizza," scrapping its 49-year-old pizza recipe. The company continued to innovate with the introduction of Pizza Profiles on dominos.com in 2013, allowing customers to save information and record their favorite order in as little as five clicks.</p>
                <p>In 2015, Domino's introduced the DXP™ (Delivery Expert), a specially designed and built pizza delivery vehicle. The car holds up to 80 pizzas and features a warming oven, as well as storage areas designed for easy loading and unloading of pizzas and other menu items.</p>
                <p>Today, Domino's continues to be a leader in the pizza industry, with thousands of stores worldwide and a commitment to innovation and customer satisfaction.</p>
